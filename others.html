I'm currently working with this book to reconnect with
my natural voice. I've been disconnected from my true
voice for more tan two decades, this book is helping me
work through the habitual ways I used to use my voice
that wasn't natural. I've set a goal to work om the 
exercises in thi book for 2 hours every day. Having confident,
authentic voice is one f the top life skills
to develop if you want to succeed in 
anything.

There are so many benefits of humming, you
can literally heal any illness with just
intention and humming. This book has
helped me out so much on my journeyof 
healing and transformation. I use humming
to warm uo to my signing and speaking and
I also combine humming techniques with
voice exercises to gradually open up my
natural voice. I've explored many healing
techniques during my journey of
reconnecting with my true self and I 
found humming to be one of the most
effective and gentle ways to heal yourself.

Breath is the foundation of all other
important life skills. I've been practicing
coherent breathing technique described in
the book and moving the brath through
the body to develop better concentration,
achieve emotitonal stability and reduce
stress and anxiety. Learning breathing
techniques will also help you develop
your natural voice speaking skills.
