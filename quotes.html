<blockquote>
<p>"Follow your bliss.
If you do follow your bliss,
you put yourself on a kind of a track
that has been there all the while wainting for you,
and the life you ought to be living
is the one you are living.
When you can see that,
you begin to meet people
who are in the field of your bliss,
and they open the doors to you.
I say follow your bliss and don't be afraid,
and doors will open
where you didn't know they were going to be.
If you follow your bliss,
doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened
for anyone else."</P>
<i>~Joseph Campbell</i>
</blockquote> 
<blockquote>
<p>"Healers are Spiritual Warriors who have found the
courage to defeat the darkness of their souls.
Awakening and rising from the depths of their
deepest fears, like a Phoenex rising from the ashes.
Reborn with a wisdom and strength that creates a
light that shines bright enough to help, encourage,
and inspire others out of their own darkness."</p>
<i>~Malanie Koulouris</i>

<p>"We are the daughters and sons of this Universe.
